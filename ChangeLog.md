        * when balancing engines
        * in vertical speed controller
        * in altitude controller
    * **Improved Deorbit and Ballistic Jump** autopilots
    * **Improved performance in Editor**

        * better performance when dragging a new part over the ship
    * **UI**
        * Vertical Flight HUD
            * made more compact
            * improved formatting of altitude and velocities
        * HUD panels are showed when TCA is uncontrollable
        * Fix: Info Panel unlocks controls when it is cleared

* v3.7.1
    * Using new uGUI dialogs from AT_Utils
    * Adapted to changes in AT_Utils

* v3.7.0.1
    * Compiled against KSP-1.10

* v3.7.0 - **Maneuver Engines Reloaded**
    * **Manual engines are no longer used for horizontal thrust**, 
    instead _the maneuver engines are used_.
    * Added *Mode* of operation *of maneuver engines*
        * Rotation & Translation -- a maneuver engine in this
        (default) mode responses to both rotation and translation
        controls and may be used for horizontal thrust.
        * Rotation -- a maneuver engine in this mode only responses
        to rotation controls and is never used for horizontal thrust.
        * Translation -- a maneuver engine in this mode only responses
        to translation controls and may be used for horizontal thrust.
    * Fixed balancing of engine profiles that have only maneuver engines 
    active.
    * Improved handling of R&T maneuver engines that provide more thrust
    than torque (i.e. they're more or less in line with CoM).
    Even if you don't set such engines to Translation mode, they won't be
    firing much during rotation. Such engines are also no longer switched
    to UnBalanced mode.
    * Added two new settings to **Advanced Tab**:
        * **Hor. Thrust** switch toggles the use of translation-capable
        maneuver engines for horizontal thrust by on-planet navigation
        autopilots
        * **Minimum specific horizontal thrust** (which is the same as 
        acceleration) - this number limits the use of maneuver engines
        for horizontal thrust by the acceleration they can produce. So
        if your ship has maneuver thrusters for normal rotation/translation
        purposes and you don't want the TCA to try to use them as
        horizontal thrusters, just set this limit high enough.
    * Added **support for Cargo Accelerators**:
        * ModuleTCA now handles the ExecuteManeuverNode message,
        which allows it to continue maneuvers that were only partially
        executed by an accelerator.
    * Added **support for Hangar**:
        * ModuleTCA now handles onLaunchedFromHangar KSPEvent and, in case
        of launching from fairings hangar, continues what the TCA of the
        previous stage was doing (e.g. the To Orbit program).
    * Various bug fixes, including TCA WayPoints, Landing from orbit
    targeted on another vessel and more

* v3.6.2.2
    * Fixed HUD panels disappearing after scene switch
    * Compiled against AT_Utils 1.9.2

* v3.6.2.1
    * **Compatible with KSP-1.9**
    * Compiled against AT_Utils 1.9.2

* v3.6.2
    * Fixed RCS specific torque calculation for some thrusters
    * Added integration with the new CargoAccelerators mod (WIP)
    * Compiled against AT_Utils 1.9.1

* v3.6.1 - **RCS Rotation option**
    * Added **RCS Rotation** option (Advanced Tab) to disable the use of RCS 
      for attitude control. Sometimes you have enough control authority 
      from reaction wheels and only want to use RCS as thrusters for
      translation.
    * When using Bearing Control or Cruise mode the Forward Direction
      is shown even if the main window is collapsed
    * Fixed attitude control in orbit for vessels without engines
    * Various small fixes

* v3.6.0 - **Status UI**
    * **Added Status Panel**
        * It replaces the status string that was located at the top of the main
          TCA window.
        * All statuses are displayed on the panel as a grid of small 
          **indicators** with icons and tooltips.
        * Indicators are divided into two groups: the top row contains
          indicators common for all situations and is shown always; below
          there are indicators relevant to VTOL flight on the surface.
        * Most indicators belong to corresponding TCA modules and in career
          game will be missing until the backend module is installed on the ship.
        * An indicator may be in 3 different states:
            * Inactive: almost transparent. The indicator is irrelevant
              right now.
            * Passive: grey icon. The situation that it should indicate is not
              present.
            * Active: red, yellow or green (configurable); sometimes blinking;
              sometimes with a sound alert (can be disabled).
    * **Added Info Panel**
        * It replaces the information pane that was located at the bottom of the
          main TCA window.
        * It shows any info that TCA modules need to display, like trajectory
          search progress.
        * Its position may be set by dragging it when it displays a message.
          When nothing is displayed you can open the Advanced Tab and press
          the **InfoPanel button** to display sample message.
        * As before, some messages disappear after a short time and some are
          displayed until you click on them.
    * Show collapsed TCA window after 300ms of mouse hovering. Hide it after
      500ms when mouse left its bounds. This prevents flickering when mouse
      accidentally passes through collapsed window.
    * When the **Anchor** program is activated above a building, the anchor
      whaypoint is placed on top of that building rather than on the ground
      below it.
    * Added progress indication for initial scans when Rendezvous Autopilot.
      starts to search for possible transfers.
    * Do not display up/down arrow in Vertical Flight HUD for |v.speed| < 0.01
    * When Rendezvous Autopilot is aborted its trajectory calculation tasks
      are canceled.
    * Fixed "Getting control 0's position in a group with only 0 controls"
      exception that appeared each time TCA window was shown-on-hover.
    * Fixed relative altitude and velocity calculation.

* v3.5.9
    * Fixed ToOrbit AP _(autopilot)_
    * Increased maximum auto time warp factor to 100k.
    * Fixed several bugs in trajectory optimizer that where caused by
        the same not obvious incompatibility with KSP-1.8.
    * Do not allow to use orbital landing AP from unstable (discontinuous)
        orbits. Because in general you can't land at a ground target with only
        one fly-by.
    * Fixed game freeze when trying to find NearestApproach from discontinuous
        orbit.
    * Added "Max Days to Start" option for in-orbit rendezvous to shorten
        transfer search on huge orbits (like kerbolcentric). To use: enable the
        "Max Days to Start" switch **and** set the desired time span (in days)
        within which you wish to start the first maneuver.

* **v3.5.8**
    * Supports **KSP-1.8**
    * Improved engine balancing and attitude control with high-vectoring engines.
    * In Rendezvous autopilot: if target is already in plane with the vessel on 
        the ground, launch immediately.
    * Added RP-1 patch for tech tree parts by @GordonDry
    * TCA AppLauncher button is now visible in mapview.
    * Bug fixes: #68 #69 #71 #78

* v3.5.7
    * Only show "AutoThrottle" switch if Altitude Control or Vertical Speed Control are available.
    * Reimplemented the HUD windows using uGUI:
        * Vertical Flight Controls
        * T-SAS Controls
        * Maneuver Controls
    * Snap Desired Vertical Speed to 0 when in [-0.1, 0.1]
    * Fixed out-of-range exception in editor while trying to set empty GID
        * Closed #67
    * Fixed NRE in TCAGui.onVesselDestroy

* v3.5.6
    * In editor TCA UI is available whenever you have a command module. No engines/rcs are required to setup TCA configuration.
    * Fixed exceptions caused by TCA grouping (thanks @123nick for reporting it)
    * Other bugfixes.

* v3.5.5
    * Added ability to change UI color scheme at runtime
        * To access the Color Scheme dialog, **right-click the GC toolbar button**
    * Advanced Tab: AutoSave and Launcher/Toolbar options are now persistent.
    * Fixed RCS balancing (issue #65)
    * In-editor TCA window is now available for vessels with RCS thrusters only (issue #66)
    * Improved landing trajectory rendering using UnityLineRenderer:
        * Lines are thicker and smoother
        * Deceleration trajectory is colored according to predicted hull temperature
    * Other minor fixes.

* v3.5.4
    * Improved Land (from orbit) and Ballistic Jump autopilots with adaptations for new aerodynamic
    model of KSP 1.4.5+
    * Fixed stucking in "Testing aerobrakes" fase of the landing when no aerobrakes are present.
    * Other minor fixes in landing logic.

* v3.5.3
    * Added **TCA grouping** to facilitate docking/undocking with retaining of configurations
        * Added the ability to manually activate any TCA instance of the vessel to have, e.g. different TCA Modules enabled.
    * Various bugfixes.

* v3.5.2.1
    * Better handling of gimbal and control surface torque
    * Several small bugfixes

* v3.5.2
    * More **efficient ToOrbit/Rendezvous** from the ground with _GravityTurn_-like. With a lot of tweakable options.
        * When launching in-plane with the target TCA now tries to find a launch window to get closer to the target.
    * TCA takes into account **torque from control surfaces**.
    * Attitude Control uses Oscillation Detector to quench persistent low-frequency oscillations.
    * ToOrbit/Rendezvous AP can start without active engines.
    * Numerous fixes in Rendezvous main logic.
    * Fixed Maneuver Autopilot logic.
    * Fixed VTOLControl yaw problem
    * Fixed some Attitude Control bugs.
    * Fixed Time Warp control.
    * Improved performance of many orbital calculations and simulations.

* v3.5.1
    * Fixed collapsed window rendering.
    * Using TextureCache.
    * Restore RCS limiters when disabling TCA.

* v3.5.0
    * **Major overhaul of orbital autopilots**:
        * **Deorbit** autopilot performs **simulation of atmospheric flight and main deceleration** to determine approximate landing trajectory. Achieves much more precise landings using chutes/brakes alone; and saves fuel in powered landing.
            * Atmospheric trajectory is drawn in magenta in Map View
            * Deceleration trajectory is drawn in green in Map View
        * **Rendezvous** autopilot employs 2D gradient-descent minimization to search for optimal rendezvous trajectory in several modes:
            * **Min.DeltaV** - always prioritize the lowest total dV of the rendezvous (including deceleration)
            * **Fast Transfer** - prefers smaller total transfer times (including time before maneuver), if it does not cost too much dV
            * **Manual** - you can choose between calculated transfers yourself
    * **Full reimplementation of attitude control**:
        * Attitude control uses three separate PID cascades with gain scheduling to independently control the three rotational axes. This allows for much better control over a wider range of different engines, faster and more accurate action, and eliminates some long-standing auto-oscillation bugs.
    * **Remote control** of TCA-equipped vessels:
        * Now you can control nearby vessels equipped with TCA without actually switching to them. The control is not full, i.e. keyboard and mouse still belong to the active vessel; but TCA interface in this mode sends commands directly to the selected vessel. This, of course, only works on loaded vessels in comm-range, and only if you have Squadron Control Module installed.
    * **Default vessel configs**:
        * Now in VAB and SPH, *separately*, you can save TCA configuration of a vessel to be the default for newly created vessels. This includes state of TCA Modules and functions, so **!do not forget to activate newly bought modules!** or you'll miss it in flight. *I'm working on automation of that process.*
    * **Numerous fixes and improvements** in:
        * Navigation/Land
        * Navigation/Jump To
        * Orbital/To Orbit
        * Orbital/Match Velocity,Brake Near
        * Smart Engines
    * **Interface** changes:
        * **Removed "Set" buttons** of numerical entry fields. To set entered value push Enter or Keypad/Enter.
        * Rendezvous, Deorbit, Jump To, Orbital/Land autopilots use the Setup-then-Execute approach, so pressing, sya, "Land" button does not start landing immediately. All setup controls are now located inside appropriate tabs and are opened when you press the autopilot's main button.
    * *Much, much more in commit messages...*

* v3.4.2
    * Improved navigation autopilot (Go To, Follow Path, etc.), especially for low TWR, slow-engine VTOLs and H/VTOL-planes.
    * Improved usage of Manual engines for translation/horizontal propulsion.
    * Cruise Control, when engaged, now uses forward direction instead of _low_ current velocity. That is, ships slowly drifting backward will not try to rotate 180deg on the spot.
    * Added a button to collapse main window.
    * Fixed ATC+PersistentRotation.
    * Various bugfixes and small improvements.

* v3.4.1.1
    * Compatible with KSP-1.3

* v3.4.1
    * **Rendezvous Autopilot**:
        * Lambert Solver now works properly for retrograde transfers.
        * In rare cases when a rendezvous maneuver went perfect and the ships are on a collision course at rendezvous point, the brake burn now accounts for ships' sizes to stop before the collision.
        * Improved trajectory optimization by using the closest elliptic transfer when a para/hyperbolic transfer time is given and by adding additional maneuver start time prescan.
        * Improved fine-tuning by selecting initial transfer time to be equal to the current nearest approach time.
        * Additional fine-tuning of the approach after Match Orbits is used only when the target is out of loading range (i.e. not yet visible).
        * Coast stage is only used when distance to target is grater then the tolerance threshold to avoid unnecessary fine-tuning.
    * **Deorbit Autopilot**:
        * Landing Trajectory corrects brake time to get the proper fly-over altitude. This fixes the inability to land on a very-low-gravity worlds like Minmus.
        * Improved trajectory calculation for extremly high-lat targes (i.e. poles) + improved trajectory optimization times.
        * Initial eccentricity estimation uses current vessel orbit instead of a curcular derivative. Works better, less calculations.
        * Removed redundant label from Deorbit Settings.
    * **Macros**:
        * Added tooltips to Macro Actions and Conditions.
        * Added Dynamic Pressure condition and Execute Maneuver action.
    * **Interface**:
        * Updated the Manual
        * Added separate icons for Toolbar and AppLauncher. Made the new MAN icon.
        * Made Module Selector available in flight to show the modules installed on a ship.
        * Added hotkey removal by pressing BACKSPACE when selecting the ky.
        * In Editor Window renamed TWR to TMR (thrust to Mass ratio).
    * Engine clusters are not switched while in time warp anymore.
    * TCA's time warp control stays enabled when KSP limits warp rate by altitude.
    * Added emergency dewarping if TCA's time warp is disabled and the ship is in time warp near the upcoming maneuver.
    * Maneuver offsets now take into account minimum turn time of a ship.

* v3.4.0
    * **User Interface Overhaul**
        * Controls were split up into Tabs and Floating Windows
        * As a result, the main TCA window became much smaller
    * **TCA Modules Selection**
        * Now you can select which TCA modules will be installed on you ship during construction (in VAB/SPH)
        * This may considerably decrease the amounts of controls you see in TCA window
        * But **OTA updates were disabled** for safty reasons. In-flight upgrades of ship's mainframe are now considered too risky!
    * Added the new **[T+ rV-]** attitude cue that targets ship's engines so that continious thrust will propell the ship towards the target while correcting any lateral drift. Very usefull for approaches from a distance.
    * Added Smart Engines switch to Engine Profile to set S.E. mode when profile is activated.
    * Corrected logic of the Approach stage of Rendezvous autopilot to make it safe to approach huge targes (like asteroids).
    * Orbital autopilots are now not available when there's only Maneuver engines onboard.
    * Many bugfixes.

* v3.3.4
    * Added **Engine Profile Autoconfiguration** in Editor.
    * Added **Smart Engines** mode for orbital flight:
        * In this mode engines are automatically grouped by thrust direction (e.g. all aft engines and all forward engines).
        * Then, when a big change in thrust direction is needed for a maneuver (say, 90 or 180 deg), an appropriate group is selected and enabled, while other groups are disabled.
        * There are 3 methods of selecting the appropriate group:
            1. Min. rotation: the selected group is the closest to the needed direction.
            2. Min. maneuver time: if groups differ in total thrust, the selected group is the group that has the smallest maneuver time, including time needed to change ship's attitude.
            3. Fuel efficiency: for small delta-V this falls back to Min. maneuver time; for large delta-V the total Isp of the group is also considered, and the group with the largest Isp has much more chance to be selected.
    * **Improved TimeWarp** interaction with user/mods:
        * Now TCA detects if something trying to decrease time warp and surrenders its control. This allows KAC, for instance, to make its gradual dewarping. And it allows a user to press DECREASE_TIMEWARP (default ',') or STOP_TIMEWARP (default '/') buttons and take control over the warp.
        * An on-screen message will inform you of any such event.
    * Added **Launch Clamps handling** by Rendezvous and ToOrbit autopilots. If you forgot to configure proper stage order for the clamps, TCA will automatically release them when needed.
    * If a ship has only one active engine and this engine is coaxial with the CoM, TCA automatically changes its Role to **UnBalanced**. This prevents much of a surprising and undesired ship's behaviour.
    * Fixed TCA Modules availability in **Science Sandbox** mode.
    * **Improved Rendezvous** autopilot's performance in case of escape trajectories and ultra-high altitude orbits (near SOI boundary).
    * **BrakeNear** autopilot now informs you about too large approach distance and waits for confirmation.
    * Fixed inappropriate active/inactive state of MatchV/BrakeNear buttons.
    * Miscelaneous bugfixes.

* v3.3.3
    * Considerably **improved Bearing Control**:
        * It now uses 2-PID cascade, which is a more geneal solution. Works much better for medium to heavy crafts (Max.AA ~0.1-3 rad/s2). Very high-torque crafts (Max.AA ~10-15 rad/s2) work fine, but don't react as quickly as they *possibly* could.
    * Implemented **active gimbal handling**. Now engines with gimbal capability will be using it for maneuvering.
    * In Editor, added highlighting of the command part where TCA is active.
    * Fixed target and orbital attitude cues calculation for Kerbol-centric orbits.

* v.3.3.2
    * Fixed ToOrbit Autopilot for ~0 inclination target orbits.
    * Fixed Deorbit Autopilot for retrograde orbits.
    * Improved ETA and brake time calculation in Point Navigator. Should help with overshooting problem in low gravity and with slow engines.
    * Improved LandingAutopilot performance for low-thrust ships.
    * Maneuver Autopilot now aborts the maneuver if no fuel left.
    * Show Countdown and Thrust Duration for uncontrollable ships too.
    * Various bugfixes.

* v3.3.1
    * Compiled against **KSP-1.2.2**
    * Fixed the "**black kraken**" bug.
    * **In-Editor engines' balancing:**
        * Added "Wet CoM" and "Dry CoM" markers. Added switching between wet/dry mass for engines' balancing.
        * When TCA is disabled InEditor, balancing is also disabled and thrust limiters are reset to 100%.
    * **Deorbit Autopilot**:
        * Now aware of reentry heating and tries to avoid it (tested on Eve).
        * Can automatically use brakes and/or parachutes during deceleration to conserve fuel.
        * Has configurable "**Landing Settings**": Use Brakes, Use Chutes, Correct Target, Land ASAP.
    * Minor bugfixes.

* v3.3.0
    * **In-Editor engines balancing with visualization** to help building balanced crafts:
        * The thrust limiters of balanced engines are set automatically, so you can see the projected in-flight performance of an engine directly in the right-click menu.
        * The TCA Editor UI now has a "Balanced: N%" indicator at the bottom that shows the thrust limiter of the most down-throttled engine. And the "HL" button to highlight engines according to their efficacy (0% magenta > 50% yellow > 99% cyan > 100% no highliting).
        * When you pick up an engine and move it, trying to attach to a ship, TCA rebalances and indicates the results (as descrived above) in real time; so you can easily achive decent initial balancing.
        * Note, that only the initial (wet) mass is used for balancing. For now.
    * **Waypoints**:
        * Implemented **full, one-way** integration with Stock/WaypointManager waypoints: Stock waypoints may be viewed as a list in TCA window and added to the navigation path (one by one or all at once). *Note, that only the navigatable waypoints on current planet are shown in the list.*
        * Implemented scenario-wide **repository of navigation paths**.
        * Implemented **full waypoint editing + altitude change by mouse**.
            * Including Name, Altitude, Latitude and Longitude, Land and Pause states.
            * Added Edit button to waypoint list. A currently edited waypoint is highlited by size and color.
        * Implemented **waypoints sorting** in the navigation path using **^** (up) button.
        * Cosmetics:
            * Waypoints added by mouse use sequential numbers in names: "Waypoint 1", "Waypoint 2"...
            * Coordinates are now displayed as N/S, E/W instead of counterintuitive angle between 0-360 deg.
            * Displaying vertical distance to the next waypoint in  the List.
            * A waypoint set to "Land" is highlighted with size.
    * Improved **Landing from Orbit**:
        * *Before* the main deceleration burn the autopilot now scans the surface around the target in search of a flat patch to land on. If it is found, the target is automatically corrected, which saves the fuel later, as the need to fly around after deceleration and physically search where to land is almost completely eliminated.
        * The time a ship will need to turn from almost-horizontal to vertical orientation during deceleration is now taken into account during landing trajectory calculation. This prevents crashes of very bulky ships.
        * Corrected calculations of the amount of the fuel needed for powered landing. Fuel shortage should not come as a surprize anymore.
    * Improved **VTOL Assist**:
        * Improved support for very small vessels.
        * Landing gear is not deployed if a user/autopilot does not intend to land (checked by desired altitude and engines' state).
        * The deployment time of the landing gear/wheels is now taken into account; and Assist overrides vertical velocity and holds the ship's descend (if needed) untill the gear is deployed.
        * After landing it smoothly corrects ship's attitude to place it on a tilted surface (if the ship have enough control authority).
    * Improved the way **Radar + Altitude Control + Point Navigation** work together:
        * Ships are allowd to **fly through holes** in scenery if they're small enough.
        * Altitude Control and Point Navigator now properly take into account target's altitude.
        * Point Navigator also takes into account the value of altitude ahead (as calculated by Radar).
        * Changed the meaning of Waypoint's Pause button: now the ship Stops first, then pauses the game.
        * And if both Land and Pause are toggled, the ship will first land, then pause the game.
    * Improved **Maneuver Autopilot**:
        * Now it correctly catches the moment when the control authority becomes too low to pursue that last bit of dV.
        * Added in-flight engines' prebalancing to correctly calculate maximum thrust on unbalanced ships.
    * Improved Bearing Control and Attitude Control performance.
    * Added **CPS** (Collision Prevention System) and **H-Translation** (Use RCS for horizontal speed corrections) toggles to "advanced" and TCA Editor UI.
    * When the game is paused TCA will not process keyboard events. No more disabling TCA while typing in a savegame name.
    * Many bugfixes.

* v3.2.5
    * TCA is now available on vessels that have only reaction wheels.
    * **Waypoints**:
        * Integrated TCA waypoints and Stock/**WaypointManager** waypoints: currently active Stock waypoint can be used as a target for *Go To/Jump To* programs and added as TCA waypoint for *Follow Path* program.
        * Made TCA waypoints **draggable**: *point the mouse at a waypoint, leftclick-and-drag to change its location; release the left button to confirm; press the right button (while still pressing the left one) to cancel.*
        * Improved waypoints/path overlay: 
            * Waypoints now fade out with distance-along-the-path; but they also fade in with distance from the camera to the ship, so that when you zoom out from the ship the whole path becomes visible.
            * Added colored lines that connect waypoints along the path.
    * **Integrated TCA with KerbNet**. TCA now acts as a stand-alone computer that can fly a ship out of signal. But TCA controls will become locked, so you can't control such a ship. *Squadron Mode* now also uses KerbNet to establish connection with controlled vessels.
    * *Level* program and *VTOL Mode* do not take manual thrust into account anymore.
    * Improved maneuver execution: Throttle Control now takes into account current steering request when applying differential thrust limit. Maneuver Autopilot automatically disables itself in case of inadequate thrusting near the end of the maneuver.
    * Improved landing trajectory calculation and landing algorithm: better support of ships with low Thrust/Mass ratio; fixed rapid engine bursts during final deceleration.
    * Added **CPS switch** in "advanced" pane to toggle Collision Prevention System.
        * Bugfix: a kerbal EVA does not trigger CPS response if it is on a ladder that belongs to the ship.
    * Added **H-Translation** switch in "advanced" pane to disable TRA usage of translation for horizontal speed corrections.
    * *Jump To* now also autosaves the game, like the *Land* program does.
    * Fixed TCA part info updating in Editor.
    * Added **Toggle Action Groups** and **Set Action Groups** macro actions.
    * Fixed macro saving/loading.
    * Moved ToolbarWrapper to AT_Utils and updated it.

* v3.2.4
    * **Compatible with KSP-1.2**
    * ToOrbit Autopilots
        * Added user-definable slope parameter.
        * Engines will now always have full thrust until initial apoapsis is reached.
        * Fixed inclination correction algorithm.
    * ThrottleControl now applies Angular Error correction differently: it will not affect engines that provide torque, so that a ship could retain maneuverability.
    * Main throttle is set to 0 on launch if a ship have active engines (in the active profile).
    * Improved support of slow engines.
    * Bugfixes.

* v3.2.3
    * Bugfixes:
        * Fixed rendering of surface markers.
        * Fixed incorrect calculation of Landing Trajectory in some cases.
        * Fixed a bug in maneuver execution that caused it to block sometimes when a maneuver is finished.
        * Fixed and improved landing algorithm of Deorbit Autopilot.
        * Fixed Radar bug that was caused by not resetting the Altimeter.
    * Improved ToOrbit autopilot algorithm.
    * Improved low altitude landing algorithm.
    * Ballistic Jump now uses the Minimum Energy trajectory to conserve fuel. Also fixed instability in gradient-descent optimization of the jump trajectory.
    * Improved Deorbit Autopilot:
        * Better initial orbit calculation.
        * Added orbit correction that ensures that dorbiting ship will have at least 2km above the target after the main deceleration.
        * Improved landing algorithm.
        * Improved detection and handling of landscape obstacles.
    * Attitude Control uses new Oscillation Detector to quench sporadic oscillations in control output.
    * Improved PersistentRotation management.
    * The "Enabled" button now flashes red if TCA is disabled when flying.

* v3.2.2
    * Bugfixes:
        * TCA no longer activates a part where it is installed (parts that combine command module with engines should work fine now).
        * Fixed incompatibility with RealismOvehaul.
        * Fixed and improved initial trajectory calculation in DeorbitAutopilot/BallisticJump.
        * In career game: locked maneuver nodes no longer cause NREs in ToOrbit autopilot.
    * Improved orbital landing algorithm; should work better with both stock and FAR aerodynamics.
    * TCA is now aware of PersistentRotation and will wait for the ship to stop rotation before entering the TimeWarp.
    * Added "Status" page to TCA Manual. It shows a warning if TCA is installed improperly. And in career mode it displays purchased TCA modules (including the main subsystem) and their statuses.

* v3.2.1
    * Numerous fixes and improvements to:
        * *Deorbit autopilot*
        * *Landing autopilot*
        * *Attitude* and *Bearing* control
    * Compiled against *AT_Utils* library that will now be common to all my mods. It is distributed with TCA, so no additional action is required.
    * The naming convention of the `.glob` and `.user` files has changed: these files are now named `ThrottleControlledAvionics.glob` and `ThrottleControlledAvionics.user`. If you have done any customizations, don't forget to rename your `TCA.user` file accordingly.

* v3.2.0
    * Added orbital autopilots ([see the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1e2brjWgBA)):
        * **ToOrbit autopilot** that achieves a circular orbit defined by radius and inclination, prograde or retrograde. It is smart about high orbits as it uses the double-burn technique, which is how the real satellites get to the geostationary orbit.
        * **Rendezvous autopilot** that can bring a ship to its target-in-orbit from anywhere in the same sphere of influence: from orbit, from a suborbital trajectory and from the surface.
        * **Deorbit autopilot** that lands a ship from orbit precisely at the selected target.
        * **Ballistic jump** that brings a ship to a target located far away on the surface of the same planet using a ballistic trajectory. It is, of course, better to use it in vacuum or sparse atmosphere.
    * Added **VTOL Control** module that allows you to control a VTOL like a copter in a remote-controller style ([see the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWFwzOA9YG0)).
    * **Renamed** two engine modes. I hope this way it's more intuitive:
        * Main = "Thrust & Maneuver"
        * Balanced = "Thrust"
    * **Control-freak special**: added a set of switches to the advanced tab that allow to disable automatic usage of Staging, Landing Gear, Brakes and Parachutes.
    * Added **verbose status messages** at the bottom of the TCA window. *These are persistent and may be dismissed by clicking on them.*
    * **Numerous bugfixes and improvements** in almost every module.

* v3.1.0
    * Added **bearing controls** to the main GUI and keyboard. Works independently of CruiseControl, e.g. you may set the bearing in Stop or Level mode.
    * Added **UnBalanced** engine mode which is a mix of Main and Manual: like Main it responses to altitude/vert.velocity controls, but like Manual it is not used for controlled torque generation. Like Manual engine it may be balanced with other engines in Main, Maneuver or Balanced modes. The main use: to make single-engine balanced-by-design VTOLs and rocket landers.
    * Added **configurable button colors**. See the top the *TCA.glob* file for details.
    * Settings in *TCA.glob* could (and should) now be overwritten in GameData/ThrottleControlledAvionics/**TCA.user** file. Read **[the manual](https://github.com/qfeys/ThrottleControlledAvionics/blob/master/GameData/ThrottleControlledAvionics/INSTRUCTIONS.md#tcaglob--the-global-tca-settings)** for details.

* v3.0.1
    * Fixed single-engine optimization bug.
    * Fixed onStage profile update bug.
    * Improved HSC behaviour at very low maximum TWR of slow engines by adding correction for negative vertical speed.
    * TCA GUI now only shows when the active vessel is loaded and unpacked.

* v3.0.0
    * TCA is now a Part Module running in a ship's cockpit/probe-core. This means **many ships may run TCA simultaneously**.
    * TCA has **TONS** of new features. Please, read **[The Manual](https://github.com/qfeys/ThrottleControlledAvionics/blob/master/GameData/ThrottleControlledAvionics/INSTRUCTIONS.md)**.
    * These features are divided into modules and distributed along the TechTree in career mode. Even more, there are cross-module dependencies that do not follow the stock tree. Please, consult **[TCA Tech Tree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3yiXDvgwkLMMWNHTUdwMkpRYUk/view)** graph to know more.

**Acknowledgments**: I want to express extreme gratitude to **[smjjames](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/134004-smjjames/)**, who helped me so much with the testing and proposed countless improvements. Without it this version would never have come to a release!

* v2.3.0.1
    * Fixed issues with engines' balancing when Vertical Speed Control is disabled.
    * Fixed handling of flameouted engines.
    * Fixed issues with changing TCA key on some OSes.

* v2.3.0
    * Added "Balanced Thrust" engine Role. With it you may use jets and other slow-response engines as a main lifting force; they are still unusable for maneuvering.
    * Improved Vertical Speed Control System: actual vertical speed is much closer to the set-point now.
    * Improved flip-over prevention system of Kill Horizontal Speed mode: it now considers current TWR and decreases the pitch angle if it drops too much. Also useful for jets, as they tend to loose power when turned against the air stream.
    * Several smaller improvements.

* v2.2.1.1 - compatible with KSP-1.0.4
    * Fixed engines' velCurve effect calculation when balancing engines.
    * Added atmCurve effect calculation.

* v2.2.1 - compatible with KSP-1.0.2
    * Fixed compatibility issues with the new KSP-API
    * Added UseStockAppLauncher flag into TCA.glob to force the use of AppLauncher even if the Toolbar is installed.

* v2.2.0
    * Added **engine modes**: Main, Maneuver, Manual.
    * Improved balancing of engines that have velocity curves.
    * Torque from **SRBs** and other throttle-locked engines is now **accounted for**.
    * Tuning parameters are now hidden when Autotuning is enabled.
    * Many **performance improvements**.
    * Fixed the conflict with FMRS window.

* v2.1.0
    * Added an **autopilot to kill horizontal speed**. Useful for landing.
    * Added **per-game configuration**; vessel configs are not lost on game switch anymore.
    * Fixed the regression in optimization algorithm and **improved balancing of asymmetric designs**.
    * Fixed problems with steering from the External Command Seat.
    * Other minor fixes.

* v2.0.2
    * **Integrated TCA into career mode.** You will have to purchase it in Specialized Controls to use it.
    * Improved optimization algorithm. Controls should be smoother and thrust should not decrease when torque demand is inadequate.
    * TCA key binding is configurable from the GUI now.
    * Added an option to control vertical speed slider with throttle controls.    

* v2.0.1
    * Modified optimization algorithm to work properly with engines which minThrust is not zero; Vertical Speed Factor is now also taken into account.
    * Corrected Toolbar/AppLauncher icon switching with TCA state.
    * When Loosing Altitude, vertical speed is still displayed.
    * Positions of the windows are now properly saved and loaded.
    * Fixed KSP-AVC .version file to comply with the strict JSON and to work with CKAN.

* v2.0.0
    * Drastically **improved in-flight stability** by completely changing the way engines' limits are calculated. Now it is done via iterative optimization of the error function.
    * Added **smooth vertical speed control** which allows not only hovering, but also fast and agile horizontal flight; even with very unbalanced designs.
    * Added **several configurable parameters** that allow to tune TCA even for the most bizarre ship designs.
    * Added **automatic parameter tuning** that works well with stock SAS and standard ship builds.
    * Added **sophisticated settings system** with separate Global, Per-Vessel and Named configurations. Configuration files are automatically generated on first launch and are located under **`Plugins/PluginData/ThrottleControlledAvionics`**
        * The default **TCA.glob** file contains, among other presets, the **key binding** for enabling TCA.

* v1.4.1

    * KSP-0.90 compatible
    * Made Toolbar support optional.
    * Added basic support of the stock AppLauncher.
    * Added KSP-AVC support.
    * Fixed the "NullRef on engine destroyed" bug.
    * Optimized performance a little.
    * Changed Mod folder structure to canonical form.

* Unofficial v1.3

    * Checks whether engines are ignited or not, so engines that are not yet staged or deactivated buy GUI or actiongroup are unavailable for the calculations.
    * Uses an engineWrapper class (from EngineIgnitor suggested by camlost) to support engines of the type ModuleEnginesFX (like RAPIERs) along normal engines.
    * Supports parts with multiple engine parts (such as RAPIERs)
    * No longer stops looking for engines after finding an SRB.   
    * I hope the problem Beetlecat was having is fixed as well. (Since TCA now detects engines much better)
